# Planship marketing page

This project serves as the [Planship](https://planship.io) marketing site and (soon) demonstrates how Planship integrates with marketing pages to make changing SaaS plans and subscriptions simple. 🐶🍖

## Getting started

```bash
# Enter the root directory for the Planship marketing site
cd marketing-site

# Install deps (npm, yarn, etc.)
npm install

# Start the dev server
npm run dev
```

To start the server and open the app in a new browser tab, use `npm run dev -- --open`.

## Building

To create a production version:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.
